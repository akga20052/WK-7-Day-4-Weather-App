# WK-7-Day-4-Weather-App
Before beginning the project watch the "JavaScript Weather Data Project Demo"

Using the Open Weather API create a weather application that displays the High, Low, Forecast and Humidity using JavaScript.

You will need to get your API from openweathermap.org. Sign up for a new account, and you will be given an API key which will authenticate and allow you access to the data.

(Creative freedom is encouraged here)

You will possibly need to change the weather data from Kelvin to Farenheit using this formula (Depending on the api endpoint you are accessing)

(32K − 273.15) × 9/5 + 32 = -402.1°F

You can add a zip code to your project if you wish (not a strict requirement). 

Once the project is complete, commit the project to github and submit the github repository link to the assignment.
